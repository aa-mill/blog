{"posts":[{"title":"Welcome","text":"I’m a second-year Applied Mathematics Ph.D. student at Harvard University. I’m broadly interested in AI for scientific applications, with a focus on geometric deep learning methods for turbulent flow modeling. I’m lucky to be a member of the Computational Science and Engineering Lab, led by Dr. Petros Koumoutsakos. The goal of this blog is simply to share notes on topics I’m learning about or find useful. I hope it’s a nice way to practice my technical writing, and I’d like to have a reference of the way I’ve personally come to understand different ideas. I don’t intend to suggest that I’m an expert in the material I discuss. In this spirit, I try to openly point out areas where I still have questions or an incomplete understanding, both to keep track of these places myself and to invite others to contribute any answers, comments, or insights they may have. I’m appreciative of anyone who takes the time to read my posts or reach out. I look forward to writing!","link":"/blog/2023/09/10/welcome/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[],"pages":[]}
